# Flood Area Segmentation in R

This project focuses on performing **image segmentation** to detect **flooded areas** based on provided images and masks.  
The model is trained using a U-Net architecture and evaluated on segmentation accuracy.

The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle: Flood Area Segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faizalkarim/flood-area-segmentation).

## How It Works

- Images and corresponding segmentation masks are loaded from the dataset.
- Preprocessing steps include resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.
- A **U-Net** convolutional neural network is built for pixel-wise classification.
- The model is trained and evaluated on a train/test split of the data.
- Results and segmentation examples are visualized in the final report.

The full workflow is documented in `flood-segmentation.qmd`  
and summarized in `report-flood-segmentation.html`.
